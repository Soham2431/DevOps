1. Basic Commands & File Management

ls -ltr → listing files with details.
cd /path/to/dir → change directory.
pwd → print working directory.
cp, mv, rm, mkdir, rmdir → copy, move, delete files/directories.
find / -type f -size +10M → find files larger than 10MB.
How to find files modified in the last 24 hours? (find /path -mtime -1)
How to filter a single line from a file? (head -1, awk '{print $1}', etc.)
grep vs egrep → searching patterns.

2. Process & System Monitoring

ps aux vs ps -ef → difference and usage.
How to identify the process consuming most CPU/memory? (top, ps --sort=-%cpu)
top, htop → monitor CPU/memory.
free -m → check memory usage.
df -h → disk usage.
du -sh * → folder sizes.
uptime → system load and interpreting load average.
How do you find which process uses a specific port? (ss -tlnp | grep :<port>)
vmstat 1 5 → system performance stats.
How to kill a process? (kill PID, kill -9 PID)
CrashLoopBackOff troubleshooting → check logs, resources, process status.

3. Networking

How to check which ports are open/listening? (ss -tlnp, netstat -tuln)
How to check connectivity? (ping, curl -I)
Difference between NACL and Security Groups (conceptual networking in Linux/AWS context).
Linux Package Management
Installing package using sudo apt-get install → if package not found (apt-get update, apt-cache search <package>).
File Permissions & Ownership
chmod 755 file.sh → change permissions.
chown user:group filename → change owner.
Difference between hard link and soft link (ln vs ln -s).

4. Shell / Scripting

Write a Bash script to check CPU utilization and send email if > 80%.
xargs command → usage in pipelines.
How to schedule a job every 5 minutes using cron (crontab -e, */5 * * * *).
Text Processing & Git-related Linux Commands
git status, git stash, git squash, git fetch vs git pull (basic command-level Linux usage for DevOps context).
How to find difference between two files with many lines (diff / comm / cmp).

5. Logs & Troubleshooting

How to check logs of a process.
If system or service is down (e.g., ELK cluster), how to debug using Linux commands.
Check file existence, size, permissions (ls -lh, stat, file, head/tail).
