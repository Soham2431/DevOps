docker volume create mongo
docker run --rm -d --name app1 -v mongo/data/db mongo:latest
To enable the container to do docker ps when we are inside container ( DOCKER SOCK IS NOT THERE BECAUSE ITS IN BETWEEN DOCKER CLIENT AND DOCKER HOST WHICH ACTUALLY HELP US TO 
RUN THE COMMANDS LIKE IN THIS WAY DOCKER KNOWN TO EXECUTE DOCKER PS ON DOCKER ) 
docker run --rm -d --name app1 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --network none kiran2361993/troubleshootingtools:v1-d --name app1 -v
